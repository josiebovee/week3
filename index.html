    <h1>Hi, I’m Josie!</h1>
    
    <p>
    I currently live in Monticello, MN where I grew up. I am in my final year at MSU, where I will graduate with a degree in Marketing and Graphic Design. I work as a Graphic Designer for <a href="https://dahlheimerbeverage.com/">Dahlheimer Beverage</a>, right here in Monticello. I live with my family of five, plus our two dogs and one cat. It’s nonstop in this house, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m a people person who usually has a cup of coffee in hand, and my filled-up planner in the other.

    <p>I grew up always being on the go, and that hasn’t slowed down as I got older. I currently work full time, do school full time, coach volleyball, exercise, spend time with family and friends, and still manage to get 8 hours of sleep each night. In my free time, I like to </p>
      
    <ul>
        <li>play with my dogs</li>
        <li>online shop</li>
        <li>do yoga</li>
        <li>read</li>
        <li>travel</li>
        <li>move my body</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>I am passionate about helping others, self-love, and working towards a goal.
    </p>

    <p>After I graduate, I will continue to work at Dahlheimer Beverage while slowing the rest of my life down for a bit to enjoy the graduated life. I don’t plan on working here forever, as I would like to either move out of state or towards the cities so I can spread my wings and see new things. The perfect job would be an event planner or project manager of some sort, so I can put my people and organization skills to work. On the side, I would like to start a blog filled with things I love: self-care, exercise, recipes, and other lifestyle topics. I also hope my future is filled with dogs. </p>

    <p>I hope this class brings out more creativity in me. Although I have a graphic design minor, I am a strong Type-A person who usually focuses more on the bones of a project compared to the creative details. However, web design is the perfect project for the Type-A side of me! I am excited to learn beyond the basic HTML and CSS skills, as I hope to incorporate web design in future careers. I would like to add to my portfolio on this website and potentially turn this into a regular updated blog. I am eager to see where this class takes me as I finish out my last semester at MSU!
